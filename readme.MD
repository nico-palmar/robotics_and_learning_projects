# Personal Robotics & Learning Projects

This repository contains various personal projects focused on robotics, computer vision, and reinforcement learning. Most of these are experimental or learning-focused and are not polished.

## Main Project

### `learning_rl`
A collection of experiments and exercises in **reinforcement learning** using Python.  
This is currently the primary project in this repository, exploring algorithms, environments, and basic RL implementations. As of October 2025, this is my active project.

## Other Projects

- **MarsRoverFirmware** – Firmware experiments for rover platforms.  
- **cpp_testing** – Small C++ test programs and exercises.  
- **open_cv_qr_reader** – Simple QR code reading using OpenCV.  
- **opencv_zed2_aruco** – ArUco marker detection using ZED2 cameras and OpenCV.  
- **tensorRT_inferencing** – Experiments with TensorRT for model inference optimization.  
- **uwrt_scripts** – Miscellaneous scripts used for UWRT robotics projects.

## Notes
These projects are primarily for **learning and experimentation**.  
Some code may be incomplete or unpolished.
